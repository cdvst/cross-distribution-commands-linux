This project, developed by [Cloud Development Studios](https://now4free.de), provides a utility for translating and executing Ubuntu commands on a Manjaro system. The core of this utility is a Python script that maps Ubuntu commands to their Manjaro equivalents, which are then executed on the Manjaro system.
